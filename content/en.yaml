about: >
  I am a self-driven professional with a strong focus on problem-solving, which translates into a proactive and creative approach to everyday work.
  As a way to reflect this mindset already at the CV stage, I designed this document using LaTeX and automated the generation of different language and GDPR versions with Python and the Jinja2 templating engine.
  The source code is available in my GitHub repository, which also features other projects, including an end-to-end analytical project developed with Python and Power BI.
  In addition to continuously developing my skills, I also believe in knowledge sharing within the team. I have conducted internal trainings in every position I have held.
  I’m currently looking for opportunities where I can grow while contributing to meaningful projects and team development.
