about: >
  I am a self-reliant professional with a strong focus on problem-solving, which translates into a proactive and creative approach to daily responsibilities.
  A good example of my mindset is the CV you are reading – I designed it using LaTeX and automated the generation of different language and GDPR versions with Python and the Jinja2 templating engine. 
  You can find the source code in my GitHub repository, where I also share other projects such as a Power BI model and dashboard.
  In addition to continuously developing my skills, I also believe in knowledge sharing within the team. 
  I have conducted internal trainings in every position I have held.
  I’m currently looking for opportunities where I can grow as a data professional while contributing to meaningful projects and team development.
